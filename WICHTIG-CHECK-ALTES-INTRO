ganz wichtig! siehe Yogabīja (working ed von jason) 106 und 107:

107 vor allem: guruvākyāt suṣuṃṇāyāṃ viparīto bhavej japaḥ
so 'haṃ so ham iti prāpte mantrayogaḥ tadocyate

"From the teacher's words, let there arise a reverse repetition in Suṣumnā. When the realization 'I am that, I am that' is attained, it is called Mantra Yoga."


also in the Yogaśikhopaniṣad Mantrayoga is declared to be so ham ham so (cf. Translation p. 352) und (cf. Edition p. 458 (in pdf))

p. 34, n. 72:

For example, the Dattātreyayogaśāstra (12–14) mentions only that the yogi should recite
a mantra after installing the letters into his limbs (aṅgeṣu mātṛkānyāsapūrvaṃ mantraṃ japet
sudhīḥ). The Yogabīja (106–107) describes the practice of Mantrayoga as the recitation of so
’ham (so ’haṃ so ’ham iti prāpto mantrayogaḥ sa ucyate). This is called the ajapā mantra in other
texts (e.g., Vivekamārtaṇḍa 29–31). The Śārṅgadharapaddhati (4349) defines Mantrayoga as
a practice accomplished by those skilled in repeating mantras of deities, such as Brahmā,
Viṣṇu or Śiva, and mentions Vatsarāja as an example of such an adept (br

König Someśvaras Werk Mānasollāsa ("Erfrischung des Geistes") aus dem 12. Jahrhundert über
die Erziehung junger Prinzen:
„After performing the \textbf{Upanayana} ceremony in the eighth or eleventh year, the prince should be taught in
one of the Vedas, the use of weapons and various sciences. ...They are required to be trained by experts
and repeatedly examined by experts. When the king is pleased with the progress of the princes, he
should embrace them and honour them with sweet words and presents, and the teachers should be
presented with cows, towns or even villages. After educating the princes properly, the king should get
them married.“

ganz wichtig: Im Kolloquium war Jürgen überzeugt! (was sehr gut ist), Steiner und die Studi's eher unschlüssig und Stanislav nicht überzeugt ohne den Rest des Textes zu kennen. 
Es ist sehr wichtig in der Argumentation zwar zu versuchen zu überzeugen, aber dennoch die eine Ausweichmöglichkeit zu lassen. Zumindest kann man sich darauf einstellen, dass dieses Thema kontrovers diskutiert wird.

\section{Punctuation}

The inconsistent use of punctuation marks in the available witnesses necessitates standardization. Upon close examination, it appears that punctuation has frequently been dropped or added during the transmission of the texts. The neglect or improper handling of punctuation by the copists has resulted in different versions of lists with and without punctuation. In many instances, missing punctuation has led to the addition of case endings, alteration of the text, and the combination of list items into compound formations that were not present in the original text. Although punctuation plays an important role, deviations in punctuation at the end of sentences, lists, and verse-numbering will only be extensively documented in the critical apparatus of the printed edition. This means that emendations of obvious punctuation mistakes will not be recorded in the critical apparatus. However, the digital edition of this work provides a more detailed documentation of deviations in punctuation through diplomatic transcripts of each witness, and even has a function to display sentences cumulatively.

In the printed edition of the \textit{Yogatattvabindu}, standard conventions of punctuation are followed. In verse poetry, a \textit{daṇḍa} (|) marks the end of a half-verse or half of the \textit{śloka}, and a double \textit{daṇḍa} (||) marks the end of a verse. In prose, a single \textit{daṇḍa} indicates the end of a sentence, and a double \textit{daṇḍa} marks the end of a paragraph. Variations in the use of \textit{avagraha} will be recorded, and items in lists will be separated by a double-\textit{daṇḍa}.

\section{Sandhi}

Among the witnesses we see deviating and inconsistent application of \textit{sandhi}. There is no clear evidence that originally \textit{sandhi} was intentionally not applied. This edition will therefore apply \textit{sandhi} consistently throughout the constituted text to provide a readable text sticking to contemporary conventions in Sanskrit. The variant readings concerning \textit{sandhi} are recorded consistently in the apparatus criticus. This is due to various textcritical problems arising from the inconsistent usage of punctuation which results in application or non-application of \textit{sandhi} wheter the respective witness applied a \textit{daṇḍa} or not. This is particularly the case within lists, which frequently occur in our compilation. Items were most likely originally separated by \textit{daṇḍa}. 


\section{Class Nasals}

Due to inconsistent use of class nasals among the witnesses \textit{anusvāra}s have been substituted with the respective class nasals throughout the edition.

\section{Lists}

Lists are a frequent feature in the \textit{Yogatattvabindu}. The text opens with a list of 15 Yogas and there are many more lists utilized throughout its content. To produce a consistent and easily readable edition, all lists have been identified, normalized to the Nominative Singular or Nominative Plural form of the respective item, or in the case of explanatory lists, to the Ablative Singular or Plural. The items are separated by a double \textit{daṇḍa}. Differences in punctuation and simple punctuation emendations, unless they are text-critically or systematically significant, will not be recorded in the apparatus criticus.

\section{Grammatical particularities}

Section XVII. ->

Grammatical constructions in this text may deviate from classical Sanskrit. In most cases, however, these should not be regarded as errors due to their frequency, but as phenomena of contemporary or regional language usage. Some constructions in this section and in other passages of the text use the genitive as a substitute for other cases, such as the dative, instrumental or locative (cf. \citeauthor{whitney1879} 1879: 87 [294]). In particular, this can be observed in this and other places in the text in relative clause constructions beginning with \textit{yasya}, which must be read as \textit{yasmin}, as otherwise the corresponding correlative pronoun seems to be missing, and the genitive, for example, in connection with the following word \textit{manasi} or \textit{manaḥ} (see edition text) would make the yogin the implicit subject of the sentence and the actual correlative pronoun of the construction referring to \textit{yasya}, in this section \textit{ayam} or \textit{saḥ}, would appear incongruent. At the same time, the \textit{daṇḍa}s in these constructions should be understood as commas or semicolons.

\section{Netratantra}

Netratantra

Gavin Flood, Bjarne Wernicke-Olesen and Rajan Khatiwoda
Consultants: Alexis Sanderson, Diwakar Acharya

The Netratantra (NT), the ‘Tantra of the Eye’, is an important text in Kashmir and Nepal, dating from around the early ninth century, and widely disseminated during the eleventh and probably tenth centuries. The text takes its name from Śiva as Netranātha or ‘Lord of the Eye’. It was commented on by the Pratyabhijñā philosopher Kṣemarāja (c. 1000-1050) in his extant Netratantroddyota, that itself bears witness to its importance in his desire to bring the text into the orbit of his non-dualist metaphysics. The project will edit, translate, and describe its traditions as borne witness to in the Nepalese recension of the text. Alexis Sanderson has shown how the Netratantra was connected with royalty and used in the courts by Śaiva officiants in the role of royal priest or rājapurohita. That Śaiva and Mahāyāna gurus performed ‘apatropaic, restorative and aggressive Mantra rituals’ for the protection of king and kingdom is well attested in the kingdoms of south and south-east Asia from the ninth to eleventh century and the Netratantra is a text that bears witness to Śaiva gurus in the service of kings.[1] The principle use of the text would have been the protection of the king and his family through the propagation of its ritual procedures and particularly the recitation of the netra mantra (OṂ JUṂ SAḤ in the short version). Thus, the text is a ‘universal’ (sarvasāmānya-) tantra, which ‘overrides the distinctions between the various branches of the Mantramārga […] and that between the Mantramārga and the Kulamārga by propagating a form of worship for use by royal officiants that can be inflected as required to take on the character of any of these divisions and indeed of others outside Śaivism.’[2]

The text was first brought to our attention by Hélène Brunner who describes each chapter in some detail in her 1974 paper;[3] an extremely useful source for not only the contents of the text, but for her comments on its structure and relation to other texts, and has been researched by André Padoux in his studies of the correspondences between cosmos, sound, and body[3] and of the way the netramantra is formed. Somadeva Vasudeva has done research on yoga in the text, particularly the subtle visualization and subtle body of chapter seven,[5] as has James Mallinson.[6]

It is probable that the Netratantra was composed over a long period of time and the redactor is bringing together diverse elements into a whole. There are parallels between the Netra and the Svacchandatantra although more work on the parallels and influence of the Svacchanda needs to be done.[7] David White argues that the oldest or original section of the work is the material concerned with possession and exorcism[8] and this systematic treatment of possession is indeed a notable feature of it, akin to similar treatment in the Īśānaśivagurudevapaddhati Mantrapāda chapter 42.

The central deity of the Netratantra is Amṛteśvara, called Amṛtīśa in the Nepalese recension, also known as Amṛteśabhairava, Mṛtyunjit, and Mṛtyuñjaya, whose consort is Lakṣmī/Śrī called Amṛtalakṣmī in ritual manuals based on the text.[9] After an initial chapter in which Amṛteśvara, referred to as Bhairava, responds to the questions of the Goddess by extolling the virtues and powers of Śiva’s eye, the text presents a number of visualisations of a number of deities, catholic in its range, not only from the systems of the Mantramārga but from Vaiṣṇava traditions as well.[10] Furthermore, a strong Śākta influence is evident in the text with its many references to deities and practices characteristic of the Kulamārga (e.g. chapter 7 on the subtle visualising meditation and chapter 20 on yoginīs).

The project to study the text will especially focus on the theme of models of the person or self that the text entails. Based on close philological reading, we hope to account for different understandings of the person implicit in the text. Chapters on ritual and meditation reflect the understandings of the person in the wider community of which the text is an index. In particular, three chapters, six, seven, and eight, that the text calls the mundane or gross meditation (sthūladhyānam), the subtle meditation (sūkṣmadhyānam), and the supreme meditation (para­dhyānam), correspond to three types or levels of the body, gross, subtle and supreme.[11] It seems that this threefold hierarchical structure is an attempt to order a range of practices that the Netra is incorporating and it does so with some coherence. The lowest level of meditation practice is concerned with magical protection (primarily of the king [6.35] and his family) from demonic beings. This involves the practitioner, the Sādhaka or Mantrin, constructing diagrams within which the name of the person to be protected is written along with other rites of appeasement (śāntiḥ) and prosperity (puṣṭiḥ). The subtle level concerns the visualisation of the body and the powers moving within it. The subtle meditation is especially interesting because it presents two different systems of visualisation, one in which subtle energy rises up through the body, piercing the levels to the location of Śiva at the crown of the head and a second in which that same power rising through the body releases nectar at the crown of the head that then floods the body.[12] In his commentary Kṣemarāja calls these the tantra-prakrīyā and the kula-prakrīyā respectively, the latter being an index of the Śākta kulamārga. Finally, the supreme meditation is principally a reinterpretation of the ‘limbs’ of classical yoga from the perspective of supreme reality, the level of Śiva.[13] All of these entail distinct understandings of what a person is (e.g. a permeable self in ch. 6 and 19, a processual self in ch. 7 and a gnostic self in ch. 8).

There are two major recensions of the text, one in Kashmir (where four manuscripts exist to our knowledge) and one in Nepal where again there are four manuscripts (to be described presently). These have been preserved by the Nepal-German Manuscript Preservation Project (NGMCP). The Nepalese manuscripts probably represent an older recension of the text, a judgement based on its slightly less polished language, which the Kashmiris have amended at times in the interests of producing a better text although Sanderson argues for the Kashmir origin of the text between 700 and 850 AD.[14] Of the four Nepalese witnesses, the oldest is a palm leaf manuscript (N1) of which there is a much more recent (19th century?) devanāgarī apograph (N2). N1 is dated to February or March 1200, the copying being done by Pandit Kīrttidhara, commissioned by the author of a ritual manual Viśveśvara, and completed during Caitra in saṃvat 320 (= 1200 AD).[15] Often the Kashmir reading is better semantically and grammatically, but we intend to preserve the text as it stands while noting the Kashmir variants.

\chapter{Content and Implications}

\section{Rāmacandra's Avadhūtapuruṣa}
\label{avadhutapurusa} 

Rāmacandra's passage on the Avadhūta is based exclusively on the template of SSP 6.1 - 116, selecting and modifying mainly those verses that correspond to his specific definition of Rājayoga (cf. \pageref{intro}), his Rājayoga, which is primarily characterised by a life of material prosperity. Rāmacandra's concept of an Avadhūta shows no traces of the original ascetic conception, the antinomian traits, or sometimes terrible practices of an Avadhūta. As \citeauthor{pudi2023} shows in her 2023 article \citetitle{pudi2023}, the image of the Avadhūta changes significantly from the advanced and already liberated antinomian ascetic of the early medieval Vidyāpīṭha and some early medieval Purāṇas in the following centuries. Already in the medieval Saṃnyāsa Upaniṣads of the early second millennium CE. the Avadhūta is integrated into the Brahmanical \textit{āśrama} system, its unconventional traits and unorthodox practice is tamed, and the Avadhūta is thereby elevated, according to \citeauthor{pudi2023}, to a legitimate and even the highest class of \textit{saṃnyāsa āśrama}. In \citeauthor{pudi2023}s words, to a sanitised \textit{saṃnyāsin}.

In the 18th century CE, the Avadhūta conception of the SSP moved further away from the antinomian-ascetic concept of the early Middle Ages. Apart from a single verse, namely SSP 6.20, in which the author points out that the Avadhūta sometimes immerses himself in worldly pleasures, or behaves devilishly like a naked and world-denying hermit, sometimes acts like a king, or he behaves according to the social norm, there is not a single remnant of the concept of an antinomian ascetic. On the contrary, all yogic practices originating in ascetic milieus, such as the practice of \textit{tapas}, surprisingly the oath of continuous nakedness (\textit{digambaras}) (SSP 6. 78), the practice of \textit{kumbhaka} or \textit{oṃ} recitation (SSP 6.79), \textit{bindu}-oriented practices (SSP 6.83), \textit{khecarīmudrā} (SSP 6.84) and other \textit{mudrā}s (SSP 6.86-97) are rejected and characterised as not practical.

All those who adhere to these practices and wear a begging bowl cannot attain liberation. The avadhūta of the SSP is no longer an ascetic but nothing other than the supreme and ultimately liberated yogi \textit{par excellance}located beyond the \textit{āśrama}s (SSP 6.22). The detachment of the term from its ascetic origins observed here is particularly evident in SSP 6.4. He is "The yogi who has burnt his desires and smeared his body with their ashes and who is absorbed in the true nature of the Self is called Avadhūta". (\textit{nijasmaravibhūtir yo yogī svāṅge vibhūṣitaḥ | ādhāre yasya vā rūḍhiḥ so 'vadhūto 'bhidhīyate || 4 ||}). 
 
Rāmacandra adopts this ideal, which the SSP has further developed, and pushes the development even further. Rāmacandra makes the already purified Avadhūta presentable at the royal court by symbolically wrapping it in royal robes. In this garb, Rāmacandra's Avadhūta, the sublime and liberated person who is above all things, becomes fit for courtly-royal life, as does the Rājayoga, which also arose in an ascetic-tantric context (see \citeauthor[2019]{birch2019saiva}) and is now tailored to the specific circumstances of life in the royal court.
