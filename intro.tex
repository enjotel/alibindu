%Now, Haṭhayoga indeed is explained as that which gives the siddhi (accomplishment) of haṭha (persistence).
%One performs the wind-eating/serpent āsanam, which removes illness in the body
%and filling – kumbhaka – emptying may distribute the vāyu/wind.
%In this way, while being aware of the progress and regress of the breath one may feed on the wind continually.
%And with the six karmmas, dhauti etc., the Sādhaka of Haṭha may prepare/embellish himself.
%Thus/thereby, in the channel (nāḍī), Oh supreme Goddess, all of the winds (vāyu) are consecrated/placed.
%Then the mind may be unmoved and then bliss it really is.
%Through Haṭhayoga time will be no more, when the mind in emptiness abides.
%
%Now listen to the second disclosure of haṭhayoga:
%In space, on the tip of the nose indeed, one may remember equal to ten million suns,
%the primal forms: white, red, likewise yellow, dark blue.
%Thus meditating/visualizing, one may have a long life, free of the birth of the body,
%Equal to Śiva, this great soul, due to the blessing of Haṭhayoga,
%shall become through persistence (haṭha) a being of light and internally śiva.
%Therefore this Haṭhayoga grants accomplishment – it’s practiced by the Siddhas (accomplished ones).

\chapter{Introduction}
\cleardoublepage
The \textit{Yogatattvabindu} (YTB) is a premodern Sanskrit Yoga text on Rājayoga that originated in northern India.\footnote{The detailed discussion of the place of origin is found on p.\pageref{placeoforigin}.} The most salient feature of the work that makes it historically significant is its highly differentiated taxonomy of types of Yoga. In the YTB’s introduction, most manuscripts name fifteen types of Yoga, presented as subtypes of Rājayoga. The whole text is a yogic compendium in a textbook style written primarily in prose, where different topics are introduced in sections launched by recognizable phrases. Most sections deal with these subtypes of Rājayoga and their effects, but others also cover topics like yogic physiology and cosmogony. 

One printed edition of the YTB was published in 1905 with a Hindi translation and based on an unknown manuscript(s). This publication has the title ’ \textit{Binduyoga}’ confirmed by the printed text’s colophon. However, as I discuss in this book, the text was likely known as YTB.\footnote{A discussion of the title is found on p.\pageref{titlediscussion}.} The consulted manuscripts contain significant discrepancies and variant readings between them as well as the printed edition. A critical edition will undoubtedly improve on the published edition and shed further light on the transmission of this work. According to some manuscript colophons, the YTB was composed by one Rāmacandra Paramahaṃsa in the late 17th - early 18th century. The date of composition is uncertain, although it must predate the oldest available manuscript, which was written in Nepal saṃvat 837, which is 1716 CE. Since the text of this manuscript is missing significant and lengthy parts (25\% of the text) and contains various corruptions, one can assume that some time had passed from the original composition for the transmission to deteriorate to this extent. Therefore, it is likely that the work was composed at least a few decades before this Nepalese manuscript, perhaps sometime in the 17th century. The manuscripts are scattered over the Indian subcontinent, which suggests that it was widely transmitted at some point. Lenghty passages of the YTB are quoted without attribution in a text called \textit{Yogasaṃgraha} as well as Sundaradeva's \textit{Haṭhasaṅketacandrikā}.

The YTB has not been discussed or considered in secondary literature on Yoga. The only exception is \citeauthor{birch2014} (2014: 415–416) which briefly described the text in the context of the “fifteen medieval Yogas” and noted that a similar list occurs in Nārāyaṇatīrtha’s \textit{Yogasiddhāntacandrikā} (17th - 18th century), a commentary on Patañjali’s Yogasūtras that integrates almost and identical taxonomy of yogas within the \textit{aṣṭāṅga} format. An incomplete account of the fifteen Yogas is found within the Sanskrit Yoga text \textit{Yogasvarodaya} (YSv), which is known only through quotations in the \textit{Prāṇatoṣinī} and \textit{Yogakarṇikā}.\footnote{Manuscripts under the name of \textit{Yogasvarodaya} seem to be lost. I was not able to allocate the manuscripts of the text in any manuscript catalogue at hand.} The YSv provides a total of fifteen Yogas but names only eight of them in its introductory \textit{śloka}s. A complete account of the text is yet to be found. The \textit{Yogasvarodaya} is the primary source and template for the compilation of the YTB. Rāmacandra closely follows the content and structure by rewriting the YSv’s \textit{śloka}s into prose. Due to the incomplete transmission of the YSv, Rāmacandra’s YTB is a natural and valuable starting point for a more in-depth study of the taxonomy of the fifteen types of Yoga. The other source text that Rāmacandra used is the \textit{Siddhasiddhāntapaddhati} (SSP)\footnote{\citeauthor{mallinsononline2013} (2013) estimated the age of the \textit{Siddhasiddhāntapaddhati} to circa 1700. The extensive use of the \textit{Siddhasiddhāntapaddhati} as Rāmacandra’s source text and the bad condition of the oldest dated manuscript of the YTB suggests (not proves) an earlier dating of the \textit{Siddhasiddhāntapaddhati} up to several years or decades before 1700.} whose content he draws on, particularly in the last third of his composition. Another text that includes a similar taxonomy of twelve Yogas divided into three tetrads is Sundardās’s \textit{brāj bhāṣa} Yoga text named \textit{Sarvāṅgayogapradīpikā} which not just shares most of the types of Yogas but also many of the practices and contents found within the YTB and YSv. These complex taxonomies that emerged during the 17th and 18th centuries crossed sectarian divides and were adapted to the specific needs of different authors and traditions. The YTB thus encapsulates the diversity of Haṭha- and Rājayoga types and teachings after the \textit{Haṭhapradīpikā} (15th century) that were adopted by a broad spectrum of religious traditions and strata of Indian society. In the particular case of the YTB, there are various statements throughout the text that reveal a strategy to detach Yoga from its renunciate connotations and to enforce the supremacy and universality of Rājayoga as a practice that can yield the highest benefits even for practitioners who enjoy worldly pleasures and an extravagant lifestyle. Textual evidence suggests the possibility that YTB may be a unique example of a Rājayoga text that was composed for a warrior aristocracy, members of a royal court, perhaps even members of a royal family or, at the very least, the wealthy upper class of society.

In addition, the in-depth analysis of the YTB also provides a far-reaching insight into a complex intertextual network, all of which essentially deliver the same sets of yoga theorems and practices with minor deviations. The main focus here is on three to five \textit{cakra}s, sixteen \textit{ādhāra}s, two to five \textit{lakṣya}s, and five \textit{vyoma}s. This network spans at least an entire millennium. It can be traced back to early śivaite tantras such as the \textit{Netratantra}. From there those teachings can be found in early texts that teach Haṭhayoga such as \textit{Śārṅghadhārapaddhati} and \textit{Vivekamārtaṇḍa}. The transmission continues from there into medieval yoga texts such as the \textit{Śivayogapradīpikā} all the way down to the texts already mentioned that are directly connected to the YTB to finally arrive in the late medieval Yogaupaniṣads such as the \textit{Maṇḍalabrāhmaṇopaniṣat} and the extensive pre-modern yoga compendia such as the \textit{Haṭhatattvakaumudi} and the \textit{Haṭhasaṅketacandrikā}. The analytical examination of this network provides insights into the history of the related yoga traditions and enables, for example, the tracing of the genesis of individual yoga categories mentioned in the fifteen Yogas, such as Lakṣyayoga, whose techniques were originally taught in early śivaite tantras, but only labeled as a separate type of yoga in the 17th - 18th centuries. 

This book contains an introduction, critical edition and annotated translation of the \textit{Yogatattvabindu}. The introduction discusses provenance, authorship and the audience of the YTB. A comprehensive discussion of the taxonomy of the fifteen Yogas based on the critical edition of the YTB, together with a close examination of the above-mentioned related texts with similar taxonomies, aims to establish their position within the broader history of yoga and elucidates this premodern late stage of development in the history of Haṭha- and Rājayoga traditions. The remainder of the introduction contains an overview of the manuscript evidence and the editorial policies underlying the edition.

König Someśvaras Werk Mānasollāsa ("Erfrischung des Geistes") aus dem 12. Jahrhundert über
die Erziehung junger Prinzen:
„After performing the \textbf{Upanayana} ceremony in the eighth or eleventh year, the prince should be taught in
one of the Vedas, the use of weapons and various sciences. ...They are required to be trained by experts
and repeatedly examined by experts. When the king is pleased with the progress of the princes, he
should embrace them and honour them with sweet words and presents, and the teachers should be
presented with cows, towns or even villages. After educating the princes properly, the king should get
them married.“
(Shrigondekar 1939:20)

Laut Birch 2014 nur zwei Texte, welche die Konnotation von Rājayoga als „der für Könige geeignete Yoga“ haben:
–

„Der königliche Yoga, so wird gesagt, ist der Yoga der vom König angewendet wird."

„Rājayoga ist das Yoga für Könige, weil Herrscher in der Lage sind es zu Stande zu bringen selbst wenn sie in ihrer Position
(als Könige) bleiben. In diesem Zusammenhang ist sein [Haupt-]Merkmal das Wissen über die Vereinigung des
individuellen Selbst mit Brahman“

ganz wichtig: Im Kolloquium war Jürgen überzeugt! (was sehr gut ist), Steiner und die Studi's eher unschlüssig und Stanislav nicht überzeugt ohne den Rest des Textes zu kennen. 
Es ist sehr wichtig in der Argumentation zwar zu versuchen zu überzeugen, aber dennoch die eine Ausweichmöglichkeit zu lassen. Zumindest kann man sich darauf einstellen, dass dieses Thema kontrovers diskutiert wird.

\chapter{The List of the 15 Yogas}
\label{yogas_list}
The authenticity of the list specifying the fifteen Yogas at the beginning of the text is ambiguous. This is due to the discrepancy between the structure of the Yogas presented in the text and the order presented in the list. For example, the text commences with a description of \textit{kriyāyoga} and goes on to describe \textit{siddhakuṇḍaliniyoga} and then mentions \textit{mantrayoga} without adhering to the order presented in the list. This incongruity raises questions as to why the text structure deviates from the list. However, the reference to \textit{jñānotpattav upāyaḥ} may provide some insight into why \textit{jñānayoga} is included as the second \textit{yoga} in the list. To reconcile these apparent inconsistencies, there are several possible explanations: 1) The text is severely corrupted. 2) The list was added by a different hand at a later time. 3) The term \textit{jñānayoga} is included as a result of the practice of \textit{siddhakuṇḍalinīyoga}, which is said to generate knowledge through the central channel, as stated in the text. These explanations may be combined to provide a comprehensive understanding of the situation.

\note[type=philcomm, labelb=_1e, labele=_1e, lem={urayogaḥ}]{The term \textit{urayoga} in YSv (PT) is uncertain. Birch suggests it might result from a corruption of \textit{lakṣyayoga} since it appears in the text. However, explaining the origin of the corruption is complex. Sellmer speculates it could be an abbreviation of \textit{uragayoga} (``Snake Yoga''), possibly a synonym for \textit{kuṇḍalinīyoga}, but this is problematic as the term is unattested elsewhere.}

\section{Marking the Reliability of Sources and Testimonia in the Critical Apparatus}
\label{kennz}

To accurately depict information about the textual relationship and estimated degree of relatedness of a passage from the \textit{Yogatattvabindu} in the layers for sources and testimonia of the critical apparatus, a system of sigla was introduced.\footnote{This type of identification system is based on the use of the critical apparatus in \parencite[lii-liii]{steinkellner2005}. It was modified for the text-critical work on the \textit{Yogatattvabindu}.} The sigla are meaningful when a passage is corrupted in all witnesses and can only be reconstructed by means of other texts. The layers of the critical apparatus for sources and testimonia use the following sigla:

\begin{enumerate}
\item[\textbf{Ce}] \textit{citatum ex alio} / quotation from another (text).\footnote{The sigla \textbf{Ce} indicates an identical or largely identical content in the lesser witness and only allows for minor deviations in the wording of the passage.}
\item[\textbf{Cee}] \textit{citatum ex alio modo edendi} / quotation from another (text) with editorial changes.\footnote{The sigla \textbf{Cee} identifies passages with noticeable deviations in the lesser witness.}
\item[\textbf{Ci}] \textit{citatum in alio} / quotation in another (text).\footnote{The sigla \textbf{Ci} indicates an identical or largely identical content in the lesser witness and only allows for minor deviations in the wording of the passage.}
\item[\textbf{Cie}] \textit{citatum in alio modo edendi} / quotation in another (text) with editorial changes.\footnote{The sigla \textbf{Cie} identifies passages in the lesser witness with noticeable deviations that have the intended character of the composer.}
\item[\textbf{Re}] \textit{relatum ex alio} / (content), attested from another text.\footnote{The sigla \textbf{Re} identifies content parallels in the lesser witness that are relevant to the constitution of the critical text. It further indicates in certain cases that the composer might have used this source when composing his text.}
\item[\textbf{Ri}] \textit{relatum in alio} / (content), attested in another text.\footnote{The sigla \textbf{Ri} identifies content parallels in the lesser witness that are relevant to the constitution of the critical text.}
\end{enumerate}

The following acronyms refer to passages that originated from texts that the author of the \textit{Yogatattvabindu} utilized in compiling his work: \textbf{Ce}, \textbf{Cee}, \textbf{Re}. These texts must predate the \textit{Yogatattvabindu}. The other acronyms, such as \textbf{Ci}, \textbf{Cie}, and \textbf{Ri}, are texts that have adopted passages from the \textit{Yogatattvabindu}, or verses or passages that share similar content with the \textit{Yogatattvabindu}, but their relation is given literally, making it impossible to determine who adopted from whom. \textbf{Re} and \textbf{Ri} each refer to passages that are so closely related in content to those of the \textit{Yogatattvabindu} that they are significant in reconstructing a passage.\footnote{\textbf{Ce} and \textbf{Cee} have the highest degree of reliability, \textbf{Ci} and \textbf{Cie} have a moderate degree, and \textbf{Re} and \textbf{Ri} have the lowest.}

\section{Punctuation}

The inconsistent use of punctuation marks in the available witnesses necessitates standardization. Upon close examination, it appears that punctuation has frequently been dropped or added during the transmission of the texts. The neglect or improper handling of punctuation by the copists has resulted in different versions of lists with and without punctuation. In many instances, missing punctuation has led to the addition of case endings, alteration of the text, and the combination of list items into compound formations that were not present in the original text. Although punctuation plays an important role, deviations in punctuation at the end of sentences, lists, and verse-numbering will only be extensively documented in the critical apparatus of the printed edition. This means that emendations of obvious punctuation mistakes will not be recorded in the critical apparatus. However, the digital edition of this work provides a more detailed documentation of deviations in punctuation through diplomatic transcripts of each witness, and even has a function to display sentences cumulatively.

In the printed edition of the \textit{Yogatattvabindu}, standard conventions of punctuation are followed. In verse poetry, a \textit{daṇḍa} (|) marks the end of a half-verse or half of the \textit{śloka}, and a double \textit{daṇḍa} (||) marks the end of a verse. In prose, a single \textit{daṇḍa} indicates the end of a sentence, and a double \textit{daṇḍa} marks the end of a paragraph. Variations in the use of \textit{avagraha} will be recorded, and items in lists will be separated by a double-\textit{daṇḍa}.

\section{Sandhi}

Among the witnesses we see deviating and inconsistent application of \textit{sandhi}. There is no clear evidence that originally \textit{sandhi} was intentionally not applied. This edition will therefore apply \textit{sandhi} consistently throughout the constituted text to provide a readable text sticking to contemporary conventions in Sanskrit. The variant readings concerning \textit{sandhi} are recorded consistently in the apparatus criticus. This is due to various textcritical problems arising from the inconsistent usage of punctuation which results in application or non-application of \textit{sandhi} wheter the respective witness applied a \textit{daṇḍa} or not. This is particularly the case within lists, which frequently occur in our compilation. Items were most likely originally separated by \textit{daṇḍa}. 


\section{Class Nasals}

Due to inconsistent use of class nasals among the witnesses \textit{anusvāra}s have been substituted with the respective class nasals throughout the edition.

\section{Lists}

Lists are a frequent feature in the \textit{Yogatattvabindu}. The text opens with a list of 15 Yogas and there are many more lists utilized throughout its content. To produce a consistent and easily readable edition, all lists have been identified, normalized to the Nominative Singular or Nominative Plural form of the respective item, or in the case of explanatory lists, to the Ablative Singular or Plural. The items are separated by a double \textit{daṇḍa}. Differences in punctuation and simple punctuation emendations, unless they are text-critically or systematically significant, will not be recorded in the apparatus criticus.

Note: Mention the parallels to \citetitle{sarada} and how here \textit{svarodaya} plays an important role in the system of yoga. Also there seems to be some distant influence. I think originally there might have been was a larger section of svarodaya or even a chapter in the Yogasvarodaya which was not quoted in PT and YK!!

\section{Netratantra}

Netratantra

Consultants: Alexis Sanderson, Diwakar Acharya

The Netratantra (NT), the ‘Tantra of the Eye’, is an important text in Kashmir and Nepal, dating from around the early ninth century, and widely disseminated during the eleventh and probably tenth centuries. The text takes its name from Śiva as Netranātha or ‘Lord of the Eye’. It was commented on by the Pratyabhijñā philosopher Kṣemarāja (c. 1000-1050) in his extant Netratantroddyota, that itself bears witness to its importance in his desire to bring the text into the orbit of his non-dualist metaphysics. The project will edit, translate, and describe its traditions as borne witness to in the Nepalese recension of the text. Alexis Sanderson has shown how the Netratantra was connected with royalty and used in the courts by Śaiva officiants in the role of royal priest or rājapurohita. That Śaiva and Mahāyāna gurus performed ‘apatropaic, restorative and aggressive Mantra rituals’ for the protection of king and kingdom is well attested in the kingdoms of south and south-east Asia from the ninth to eleventh century and the Netratantra is a text that bears witness to Śaiva gurus in the service of kings.[1] The principle use of the text would have been the protection of the king and his family through the propagation of its ritual procedures and particularly the recitation of the netra mantra (OṂ JUṂ SAḤ in the short version). Thus, the text is a ‘universal’ (sarvasāmānya-) tantra, which ‘overrides the distinctions between the various branches of the Mantramārga […] and that between the Mantramārga and the Kulamārga by propagating a form of worship for use by royal officiants that can be inflected as required to take on the character of any of these divisions and indeed of others outside Śaivism.’[2]

The text was first brought to our attention by Hélène Brunner who describes each chapter in some detail in her 1974 paper;[3] an extremely useful source for not only the contents of the text, but for her comments on its structure and relation to other texts, and has been researched by André Padoux in his studies of the correspondences between cosmos, sound, and body[3] and of the way the netramantra is formed. Somadeva Vasudeva has done research on yoga in the text, particularly the subtle visualization and subtle body of chapter seven,[5] as has James Mallinson.[6]

It is probable that the Netratantra was composed over a long period of time and the redactor is bringing together diverse elements into a whole. There are parallels between the Netra and the Svacchandatantra although more work on the parallels and influence of the Svacchanda needs to be done.[7] David White argues that the oldest or original section of the work is the material concerned with possession and exorcism[8] and this systematic treatment of possession is indeed a notable feature of it, akin to similar treatment in the Īśānaśivagurudevapaddhati Mantrapāda chapter 42.

The central deity of the Netratantra is Amṛteśvara, called Amṛtīśa in the Nepalese recension, also known as Amṛteśabhairava, Mṛtyunjit, and Mṛtyuñjaya, whose consort is Lakṣmī/Śrī called Amṛtalakṣmī in ritual manuals based on the text.[9] After an initial chapter in which Amṛteśvara, referred to as Bhairava, responds to the questions of the Goddess by extolling the virtues and powers of Śiva’s eye, the text presents a number of visualisations of a number of deities, catholic in its range, not only from the systems of the Mantramārga but from Vaiṣṇava traditions as well.[10] Furthermore, a strong Śākta influence is evident in the text with its many references to deities and practices characteristic of the Kulamārga (e.g. chapter 7 on the subtle visualising meditation and chapter 20 on yoginīs).

The project to study the text will especially focus on the theme of models of the person or self that the text entails. Based on close philological reading, we hope to account for different understandings of the person implicit in the text. Chapters on ritual and meditation reflect the understandings of the person in the wider community of which the text is an index. In particular, three chapters, six, seven, and eight, that the text calls the mundane or gross meditation (sthūladhyānam), the subtle meditation (sūkṣmadhyānam), and the supreme meditation (para­dhyānam), correspond to three types or levels of the body, gross, subtle and supreme.[11] It seems that this threefold hierarchical structure is an attempt to order a range of practices that the Netra is incorporating and it does so with some coherence. The lowest level of meditation practice is concerned with magical protection (primarily of the king [6.35] and his family) from demonic beings. This involves the practitioner, the Sādhaka or Mantrin, constructing diagrams within which the name of the person to be protected is written along with other rites of appeasement (śāntiḥ) and prosperity (puṣṭiḥ). The subtle level concerns the visualisation of the body and the powers moving within it. The subtle meditation is especially interesting because it presents two different systems of visualisation, one in which subtle energy rises up through the body, piercing the levels to the location of Śiva at the crown of the head and a second in which that same power rising through the body releases nectar at the crown of the head that then floods the body.[12] In his commentary Kṣemarāja calls these the tantra-prakrīyā and the kula-prakrīyā respectively, the latter being an index of the Śākta kulamārga. Finally, the supreme meditation is principally a reinterpretation of the ‘limbs’ of classical yoga from the perspective of supreme reality, the level of Śiva.[13] All of these entail distinct understandings of what a person is (e.g. a permeable self in ch. 6 and 19, a processual self in ch. 7 and a gnostic self in ch. 8).

There are two major recensions of the text, one in Kashmir (where four manuscripts exist to our knowledge) and one in Nepal where again there are four manuscripts (to be described presently). These have been preserved by the Nepal-German Manuscript Preservation Project (NGMCP). The Nepalese manuscripts probably represent an older recension of the text, a judgement based on its slightly less polished language, which the Kashmiris have amended at times in the interests of producing a better text although Sanderson argues for the Kashmir origin of the text between 700 and 850 AD.[14] Of the four Nepalese witnesses, the oldest is a palm leaf manuscript (N1) of which there is a much more recent (19th century?) devanāgarī apograph (N2). N1 is dated to February or March 1200, the copying being done by Pandit Kīrttidhara, commissioned by the author of a ritual manual Viśveśvara, and completed during Caitra in saṃvat 320 (= 1200 AD).[15] Often the Kashmir reading is better semantically and grammatically, but we intend to preserve the text as it stands while noting the Kashmir variants.

\chapter{Content and Implications}

\section{Rāmacandra's Avadhūtapuruṣa}
\label{avadhutapurusa} 

Rāmacandra's passage on the Avadhūta is based exclusively on the template of SSP 6.1 - 116, selecting and modifying mainly those verses that correspond to his specific definition of Rājayoga (cf. \pageref{intro}), his Rājayoga, which is primarily characterised by a life of material prosperity. Rāmacandra's concept of an Avadhūta shows no traces of the original ascetic conception, the antinomian traits, or sometimes terrible practices of an Avadhūta. As \citeauthor{pudi2023} shows in her 2023 article \citetitle{pudi2023}, the image of the Avadhūta changes significantly from the advanced and already liberated antinomian ascetic of the early medieval Vidyāpīṭha and some early medieval Purāṇas in the following centuries. Already in the medieval Saṃnyāsa Upaniṣads of the early second millennium CE. the Avadhūta is integrated into the Brahmanical \textit{āśrama} system, its unconventional traits and unorthodox practice is tamed, and the Avadhūta is thereby elevated, according to \citeauthor{pudi2023}, to a legitimate and even the highest class of \textit{saṃnyāsa āśrama}. In \citeauthor{pudi2023}s words, to a sanitised \textit{saṃnyāsin}.

In the 18th century CE, the Avadhūta conception of the SSP moved further away from the antinomian-ascetic concept of the early Middle Ages. Apart from a single verse, namely SSP 6.20, in which the author points out that the Avadhūta sometimes immerses himself in worldly pleasures, or behaves devilishly like a naked and world-denying hermit, sometimes acts like a king, or he behaves according to the social norm, there is not a single remnant of the concept of an antinomian ascetic. On the contrary, all yogic practices originating in ascetic milieus, such as the practice of \textit{tapas}, surprisingly the oath of continuous nakedness (\textit{digambaras}) (SSP 6. 78), the practice of \textit{kumbhaka} or \textit{oṃ} recitation (SSP 6.79), \textit{bindu}-oriented practices (SSP 6.83), \textit{khecarīmudrā} (SSP 6.84) and other \textit{mudrā}s (SSP 6.86-97) are rejected and characterised as not practical.

All those who adhere to these practices and wear a begging bowl cannot attain liberation. The avadhūta of the SSP is no longer an ascetic but nothing other than the supreme and ultimately liberated yogi \textit{par excellance}located beyond the \textit{āśrama}s (SSP 6.22). The detachment of the term from its ascetic origins observed here is particularly evident in SSP 6.4. He is "The yogi who has burnt his desires and smeared his body with their ashes and who is absorbed in the true nature of the Self is called Avadhūta". (\textit{nijasmaravibhūtir yo yogī svāṅge vibhūṣitaḥ | ādhāre yasya vā rūḍhiḥ so 'vadhūto 'bhidhīyate || 4 ||}). 
 
Rāmacandra adopts this ideal, which the SSP has further developed, and pushes the development even further. Rāmacandra makes the already purified Avadhūta presentable at the royal court by symbolically wrapping it in royal robes. In this garb, Rāmacandra's Avadhūta, the sublime and liberated person who is above all things, becomes fit for courtly-royal life, as does the Rājayoga, which also arose in an ascetic-tantric context (see \citeauthor[2019]{birch2019saiva}) and is now tailored to the specific circumstances of life in the royal court.
